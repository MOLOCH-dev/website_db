## Abstract

A musculoskeletal model with a reflex-based controller was used to generate simulations of human gait over slow and fast speeds, and optimised to modulate the metabolic cost of transport to express normal and elevated range of costs. We identified key afferent feedback factors that may be used to estimate the rate of metabolic effort. Furthermore, we aim to develop a metamodel mapping key afferent feedback factors to effort modulation using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) as a model reduction technique. We estimated the metabolic cost of transport (CoT) of walking using a PLSR metamodel of these key factors. We also validated gait characteristics such as the economical speed (ES) using this estimated value of CoT for these key factors. We validated our predictions using model accuracy metrics and statistical tests of significance. Our results indicate that the peripheral nervous system may regulate unperturbed gait through afferent feedback factors related to muscle force generation in skeletal muscles.
