## Details

• Designed a 5 DoF Mobile Manipulator to perform dexterous tasks for industrial purposes, using Solidworks and simulated
it in CoppeliaSim and Gazebo.
• Perform Pick and place operations, implemented object detection and classification using YOLO, enable localisation with sensors and use SLAM for mobile manipulator.

• Developed FK and IK for 5 DOF Manipulator, with discrete trajectory generation by computing set of N SE(3) configuration matrices for point-to-point movement of end-effector.
