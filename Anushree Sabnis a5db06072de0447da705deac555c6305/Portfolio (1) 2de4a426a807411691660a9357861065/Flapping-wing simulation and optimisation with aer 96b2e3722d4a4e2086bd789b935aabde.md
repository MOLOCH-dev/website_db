## Details

• Extended the feedforward simulation of ornithopters by including structural effects due to wing flexibility.
• Modelled Aero-elastic effects of flapping wings in Ptera aerdynamic simulator using Matlab and Python and extracted crucial design parameters.
• Performed signal processing on experimentally obtained Force Sensor data as well as Image processing on wing deformation data to validate mathematical model.
• Performed design optimisation using Bayesian Optimisation algorithms to determine optimal design for Aeroelasticity
